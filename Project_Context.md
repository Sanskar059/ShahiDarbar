# Razorpay Configuration

Backend:
paymentRoutes.js

```js
router.post("/create-order", async (req, res) => {
  const options = {
    amount: req.body.amount * 100,
    currency: "INR",
    receipt: "receipt_order",
  };

  const order =
    await razorpay.orders.create(options);

  res.json(order);
});
```

Environment Variables:

Backend:

```env
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_live_xxxxx
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=xxxxx
```

Frontend:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
VITE_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_live_xxxxx
```

# Checkout.jsx Status

Current flow:

Customer
↓
Cart
↓
Checkout
↓
Pay Now
↓
Razorpay Popup
↓
Payment Successful
↓
Alert
↓
Home Page

---

# NEXT TASK (Highest Priority)

After payment success:

Payment Success
↓
POST /api/orders
↓
Save Order in MongoDB
↓
Clear Cart
↓
Redirect Home

Need to modify Razorpay handler:

```js
handler: async function (response) {
  await axios.post(
    `${import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL}/api/orders`,
    {
      customerName,
      phone,
      address,
      products,
      subtotal,
      deliveryCharge,
      totalAmount,
      paymentStatus: "Paid",
      razorpayOrderId:
        response.razorpay_order_id,
      razorpayPaymentId:
        response.razorpay_payment_id,
    },
    {
      headers: {
        Authorization:
          `Bearer ${userInfo.token}`,
      },
    }
  );
}
```

This is the immediate next implementation.
